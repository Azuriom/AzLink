## Setup

### Installation

The plugin works with the same .jar for all the platforms, except Bukkit/Spigot 1.7.10 which requires the legacy version of the plugin.

You just need to download the plugin, add it to the `plugins` folder of your server, and restart your server.

## PlaceholderAPI Placeholders

On Bukkit-based servers (Spigot, Paper, Folia, ...), AzLink supports [PlaceholderAPI](https://placeholderapi.com/).

By default, the available placeholders are:
* `%azlink_money%`: the amount of money the player has on the Azuriom website
