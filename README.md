AzLink is a plugin to link a Minecraft server or proxy with [Azuriom](https://azuriom.com/).

This plugin currently supports the following platforms:
* [Bukkit/Spigot/Paper](https://papermc.io/)
* [BungeeCord](https://github.com/SpigotMC/BungeeCord)
* [Sponge](https://www.spongepowered.org/)
* [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/)
* [Nukkit](https://cloudburstmc.org/articles/)
* [FabricMC](https://fabricmc.net/)

## Setup

### Installation

The plugin works with the same .jar for all the platforms, except Bukkit/Spigot 1.7.10 which requires the legacy version of the plugin.

You just need to download the plugin, add it to the `plugins` folder of your server, and restart your server.
